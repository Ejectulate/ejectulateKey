A simple script when coupled with Karabiner that opens and closes Pornhub within Chrome.
This is just a concept, we welcome you to improve on the script, or even better, create an app to remove the need for Karabiner.
After all, we're all in this together.

>* Firstly you must download and install [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/)
>* Download and install [no eject delay](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/noejectdelay.html.en)
>* Download and install our script
>* Go to System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> Services -> General -> Ejectulate
>>* Create a shortcut (cmd + option + ctrl + shift + E)
>* Within Karabiner go to Change Key
>>* Map the Eject key to the shortcut above
